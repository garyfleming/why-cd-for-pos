## Possible flow

* Setting up a scenario of dissatisfied customers, slow releases, overworked teams, and overwhelmed product owners who can't seem to deliver at pace.
* Introducing a few ideas around metrics like Lead Time, Cycle Time etc
* Introducing ideas from Continuous Delivery and Integration, at a fairly low-level
* Showing how these practices can move the metrics
* Going deeper (and drawing on experience) to show how to make Continuous Delivery tools, like Feature Toggles, useful and usable for the less technically inclined product owners

## Possible TODOs.

* Given crisis, how fast were you able to react? Change plans? Push out ideas? Experiment? Did you do anything different? *Could* you? 
* Barry O'Reilly - past success doesn’t point to future success. CI/cd help you change faster  https://twitter.com/MindtheProduct/status/1226831752066453504
* Forces you to constantly break stories down into small workable chunks to get value. Can talk about why we do agile (early release of value)
* The journey to CI/cd will help@show up a world of issues. Not being able to do it or maintain it will help you see where products might fall apart unexpectedly
* CD as strategy enablement. It’s not a strategy by itself. Helps you execute Strategery. (Talk a bit about product strategy)
* Tracey Baxter - POs speak to testers get their perspective. https://twitter.com/tbaxter78/status/1226096296567721984
* A central thesis might be that command and control product ownership is failing us. Everyone has something to contribute of value. Testers find product risks. Developers understand cost. Etc PO is not the leader. They're just one part of the puzzle. A navigator.
* we limit WIP to constrain input to what we can manage. We do CI/CD so that input is not constrained at the other end.
* Got an image of cd being seen as from commit through pipeline to prod… then zooming out a wee bit to see that it’s from a devs head through their hands into an idea then to commit… then a step back again to show it’s about the dev in team conversations with the po… then out further to have the PO talking to clients etc. It’s idea to prod!
* Learn GH Actions by publising to dreamhost on commit
* TODOs
